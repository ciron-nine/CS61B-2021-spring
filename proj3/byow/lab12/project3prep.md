# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: define a function to add hex tile to world, so just define the point add hex.
For example, i use the longest road like up left point to define the point.
just unify the define is ok.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: I guess Project 3 just use different elements to tesselation. like wall to the outside of the hexagons, other is inside.
And not hexagons, and more edges.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: Just add one single hexagons,like add one single test.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: both surrounded by wall. inside is other elements.
